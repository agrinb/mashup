# Mashup: Angel List + Mapbox APIs    

This is a simple mashup that allows you to search Angel List StartUps by industry(market) and see how many appear in each region. Default view is set to Mobile Start-ups. You can query Fashion, Healthcare, etc..

###Note: 
AngelList API returns 50 records per call. It does not allow you to query for more than 50 records at a time. Although I could have used pagination to get more results to plot. For the sake of this exercise, I chose not to.
